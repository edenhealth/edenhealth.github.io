      <div class="six columns offset-by-one">
        <p>
          The average primary care physician in the US supports 2,500 patients at any given time. Patients wait 18 days on average for a doctor's appointment, and physicians are able to see patients for only 11 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re flipping the model on its head to provide better care while, at the same time, decreasing costs to employers and the health system at large.

      <p class="name">Jeffrey Sachs</p>
      <p>
      Jeffrey Sachs is a leading health care policy expert who has worked with hospitals, health systems, health plans, behavioral health organizations, technology companies, unions, federal and state governments, and others for more than three decades.
      </p>
      <div id="jeffrey-sachs" style="display:none;">
        <p>
        Dr. Sachs was one of the architects of the recent New York State Medicaid Redesign Team process and its accompanying $8 billion Medicaid waiver. The result was one of the nation’s most innovative and comprehensive Medicaid overhauls.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2014, Dr. Sachs negotiated an agreement between the California Hospital Association and the SEIU/UHW which resulted in the establishment of a $100 million advocacy fund to support Medi-Cal. He also provided guidance on the development of California’s 2010 $10 billion Medicaid waiver.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2009, Dr. Sachs participated on President Obama’s Health Policy Advisory Committee on federal health care reform. He facilitated a joint letter signed by AHIP, PhARMA, AMA, AdvaMed, AHA and SEIU expressing support for health care reform initiatives that would decrease the annual health care spending growth rate by 1.5 percentage points as part of the negotiations around the ACA.
