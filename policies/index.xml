When you register, you will also receive email/mobile notifications letting you know that you have a communication from your care team on the Eden Health app, as well as certain other electronic communications from Eden Health, that are not encrypted and may contain certain protected health information (PHI), to identify the type of communication you have received from your care team, to respond to requests you may have initiated by email or outside of the Eden Health App, and other circumstances as outlined in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://getedenhealth.com/policies/hipaa&#34;&gt;HIPAA Policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://getedenhealth.com/policies/terms&#34;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Payment includes but is not limited to: the authorization of payment directly to the Companies of benefits otherwise payable to you. You hereby acknowledge the release of your medical records to third party insurers or authorized persons to whom disclosure is necessary to establish or collect a fee for the services provided, such as billing and collection services, insurance payers, auto accident insurers, or for work related injury to your employer or designee. You agree to forward to the Companies, all insurance or third party payments that you receive for services rendered to you immediately upon receipt.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;permission-to-treat-telehealth-medical-treatment&#34;&gt;Permission to Treat/Telehealth Medical Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By clicking &amp;ldquo;Accept&amp;rdquo; during the account registration process, you give permission to the health care providers of Eden Health to medically care for you in person, and, if applicable, by Telehealth (defined below), as applicable and appropriate. You may withdraw this consent at any time by both terminating your account and no longer seeking care from Eden Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand that part of the Service requires release of your personal health information, including test results, to an online personal health record (in accordance with our HIPAA Policy) and communication with Eden Health healthcare team electronically via the Service or the App. You consent to receive emails, SMS messages, phone calls or other communications from us pertaining to your care and your health (such as automated health reminders). You hereby authorize Eden Health to use and/or disclose my health information which specifically identifies you or which can reasonably be used to identify you to carry out your treatment and other healthcare operations. “Healthcare Operations” include but are not limited to: release of your medical information to any of your physicians and their offices or insurance companies participating in your care or treatment and the quality of that care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Health Information Exchanges” (HIEs) share information about people’s health electronically and securely to improve the quality of health care services. You authorize the Companies and the health care providers listed on the Website at www.getedenhealth.com/policies/HIE (“HIE Participants”) to obtain access to your medical records through a computer network. This can collect the medical records you have in different places where you get health care, and make them available electronically to the providers treating you. The Companies may update, at their sole discretion, the list of HIE Participants. You authorize employees, agents or members of the medical staff of the Companies to see and obtain access to your electronic health records through Healthix, which is a Health Information Exchange, or Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO), a not-for-profit organization recognized by the State of New York. This consent gives your permission for any the Companies to access your records from your other healthcare providers authorized to disclose information through Healthix. You have the right to opt-out of this consent if you provide the Companies with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at admin@getedenhealth.com or Eden Health, 108 Reade Street Suite 4F, New York, NY 10013 within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an &amp;ldquo;HIE Opt-out Notice&amp;rdquo;). If you don’t provide the Companies with an HIE Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to opt-out of the HIE consent as expressly set forth above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand that this is given in advance of any specific diagnosis or treatment and that these services are voluntary and that you have the right to refuse these services. This consent is to be continuing in nature even after a specific diagnosis has been made and treatment recommended. This consent will remain in full force unless revoked in writing and will not affect any actions that were taken prior to receiving your revocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand that virtual encounters with Eden Health or our Telehealth services via phone, email, the App or otherwise, could involve, and you hereby consent to the use of, automated tools for diagnosis, care, treatment or communication pertaining to healthcare matters. You also acknowledge that such virtual encounters with Eden Health may be provided by a variety of healthcare providers, including physicians, Registered Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, phlebotomists, and other support or medical personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Website, the App and Telehealth services are NOT appropriate for emergency or urgent medical matters. You agree that for all urgent or emergency matters that you believe may immediately affect your health, you will immediately contact your medical services provider, call 911 or go to an emergency room at a local hospital facility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Telehealth&amp;rdquo; is the delivery of healthcare services using technology when the healthcare provider and patient are not in the same physical location, and/or the virtual delivery of healthcare services, including by a medical provider or via digital or automated tools, including without limitation tools for medical or health-related diagnosis and treatment. Telehealth may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or patient education, and may include, without limitation, the following: electronic transmission of patient medical records, medical images, or other patient data; synchronous (i.e., &amp;ldquo;real time&amp;rdquo;) and asynchronous (i.e., non-&amp;ldquo;real time&amp;rdquo;) interactions via audio, video, and/or data communications; automated or digital tools for diagnosis, care, treatment and/or communication pertaining to healthcare or medical matters; and output data from medical devices, sound and video files. Further, you understand that it may be possible that your condition cannot be treated via Telehealth, or that information transmitted through Telehealth may not be sufficient or of too poor of image quality, or insufficient information or data to allow for appropriate medical decision making. Accordingly, you may be required to seek additional in-person medical care, alternative healthcare or emergency services. You agree that if your health or medical problem or condition persists after use of Telehealth via the App, you will immediately contact your medical services provider and seek appropriate additional in-person medical care or emergency care, as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANIES (OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR AGENTS) BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RELATING TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE, APP, SERVICE OR SOFTWARE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND EVEN IF THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, THE COMPANIES’ LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE, APP, SERVICE OR SOFTWARE, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF USD $100.00 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYER TO THE COMPANIES FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;u-s-export-controls&#34;&gt;U.S. Export Controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You agree to comply fully with all U.S. and foreign export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the Software nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof is exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &amp;ldquo;terrorist supporting&amp;rdquo; country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dispute-resolution&#34;&gt;Dispute Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Governing Law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agreement to Arbitrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and the Companies agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, &amp;ldquo;Disputes&amp;rdquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court, and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an (&amp;ldquo;IP Protection Action&amp;rdquo;). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide the Companies with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at admin@getedenhealth.com or Eden Health, 108 Reade Street Suite 4F, New York, NY 10013 within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an &amp;ldquo;Arbitration Opt-out Notice&amp;rdquo;). If you don’t provide the Companies with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide the Companies with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Southern District of New York and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide the Companies with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and the Companies are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the Companies otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&amp;rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &amp;ldquo;Dispute Resolution&amp;rdquo; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &amp;ldquo;Dispute Resolution&amp;rdquo; section will survive any termination of these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arbitration Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&amp;ldquo;AAA&amp;rdquo;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &amp;ldquo;AAA Rules&amp;rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &amp;ldquo;Dispute Resolution&amp;rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adr.org/arb_med&#34;&gt;http://www.adr.org/arb_med&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arbitration Process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. AAA provides a general form for a Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for California residents. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arbitration Location and Procedure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you and the Companies otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and the Companies submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arbitrator&amp;rsquo;s Decision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the &amp;ldquo;Limitation of Liability&amp;rdquo; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. The Companies will not seek, and hereby waive all rights they may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if they prevail in arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, the Companies will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Changes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if the Companies change this &amp;ldquo;Dispute Resolution&amp;rdquo; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to admin@getedenhealth.com within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &amp;ldquo;Last Updated&amp;rdquo; date above or in the date of the Companies’ email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and the Companies in accordance with the provisions of this &amp;ldquo;Dispute Resolution&amp;rdquo; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;indemnity-by-you&#34;&gt;Indemnity by You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Companies, their subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and other partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney&amp;rsquo;s fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Service in violation of these Terms and/or arising from a breach of these Terms and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-third-party-beneficiaries&#34;&gt;No Third Party Beneficiaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;waiver-and-severability&#34;&gt;Waiver and Severability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of the Companies to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Companies. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by any party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entire-agreement&#34;&gt;Entire Agreement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between the Companies and you regarding the Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between the Companies and you regarding the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;assignment&#34;&gt;Assignment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Companies’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. The Companies may assign or transfer these Terms, at their sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notices&#34;&gt;Notices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by the Companies (i) via email (in each case to the address that you have provided); or (ii) by posting to the Website or the App or via the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
